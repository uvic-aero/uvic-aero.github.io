# Radio Carrier Board

This page describes the Radio Carrier Board project, which is in-progress.

## Overview

__Work In Progress__

## Progress

A few iterations of the RCB have been designed, with none fully successful. Rev A (2018) was a draft and needed updating. Rev B ( 2019) was likely functional, but a manufacturing error made it unusable; additionally certain parts used were nearing end-of-life. The team is working towards a Rev C.
