# Ground Systems Infrastructure

This page describe the ground systems we use for controlling and monitoring flight missions.

## Overview

## How to set up the ground station

__Work In Progress__

__This page should eventually link to things like our ground flight software, any Software Team packages we use for the groundstation, describe what our setup is like. If there are particular antennas, or other devices we use, they should get a markdown file in this folder, and be linked to when mentioned__
