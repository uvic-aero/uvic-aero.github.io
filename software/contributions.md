# Contributions

If you are on this page it means you are most likely interested in contributing to a software project in this organization. We are happy to see that you have an interest in our team and that you are helping us build out our systems! In order to stay organized and avoid introducing bugs into our source code we have created a protocol that must be followed by all contributors when modifying the codebase.

## Overview

The process of contributing can be broken up into these simple steps. Each step is defined in a higher resolution through this document.

1. Create or Assign Issue
1. Create Feature Branch
1. Develop Feature
1. Rebase Feature Branch
1. Create Pull Request
1. Peer Review (Iterative Process)
1. Document Feature
1. Merge Feature Branch
