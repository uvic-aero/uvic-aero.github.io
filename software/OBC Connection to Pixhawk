# OBC Serial Connection to Pixhawk setup

The OBC (a raspberry pi) can be configured to communicate with the Pixhawk over a serial connection. This allows the OBC to retrieve telemetry data from the pixhawk.

[This ardupilot wiki page](http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/raspberry-pi-via-mavlink.html) details how to set up a serial connection between the Raspberry Pi and Pixhawk.
