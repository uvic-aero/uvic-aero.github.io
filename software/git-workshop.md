# Git Workshop

This is a workshop tutorial meant to get you up to speed with basic usage of git.

## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows 
([Wikipedia Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git))

So basically, if you and I are working on the same code, we can:
* make changes **concurrently**,
* keep track of our changes **over time**, 
* **revert to old versions** of our code, and
* systematically **merge eachother's code** into one coherent version (this usually happens automatically unless merge conflicts occur... More on that later).
