# UVic Aero Documentation Wiki

Welcome to the UVic AERO Documentation Wiki landing page. This is your entry-point into all AERO doucmentation.
This is a work in progress, so please bear with us! It will improve with time (and your help!).

The wiki is a bit of a state of evolution, but generally, it is divided in the following way:
* Team-specific documentation: where you'll find relevant information to each sub-team
* Systems: information on existing or in-progress projects

It's totally normal if you see links in pages that link to other folders. That just means there are many places to access information from, and many different sources of information. For example, a page that is project-specific may be linked to from a sub-team's page.

This page should be seen as a table of contents for the documentation.

## Sub-Teams
The following are entry-point links for the various sub-teams.

### Software
