# Mechanical

The Aero team has been working on many exciting projects. This wiki is intended to help maintain a record of the projects and descisions that were made in order to keep projects relevant and understandable.

There are three sections in this wiki

* Tutorials/Knowledge
* Unfinished Project Documentation
* Completed Project Documentation

## Tutorials
In this section these documents are designed to help members new to the mechanical team learn about skills or manufacturing processes that have been used in the past. Hopefully this section will help get you up to speed.

## Unfinished Projects
This section is designed for projects which have been started by active or current members who are not complete or are unable to finish the project and looking for a new person to take it on.

## Completed Projects
This section is an archive of projects that have been completed as part of AERO to help future members understand how to use different devices which have previously been developed.
