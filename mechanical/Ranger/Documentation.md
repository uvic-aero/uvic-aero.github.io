## General Information

Some general information that may help put the rest of the document in context is provided below.

|Item| Value |
|-----|:----:|
|Year Made| 2019 |
|Total Cost| ~$5000 CAD|
|Lead Designer| Micheal Giles|

It is also useful to note that the Ranger was based off the Scout.

## Major Components and Subsystems

The following table outlines major items included in the design. Effectively this is a high level Bill of Materials.

|Item|Quantity|Vendor|Cost|
|---|---|---|---|
|Pixhawk 2.0|1|???|$400|
|T-motor XX-ABCD|6|T-Motors|$60
|Tattu 900mAh Battery|2| Tattu Batteries|$220|
|Futuma Radio|1|???|???
|ESC's|6|???|???|
|Main Body|1|Aero*|???|*
|Motor Arms|6|Aero*|???|*
|Landing Gear|1|Aero*|???|*

_Note: Items with "Aero" listed as the vendor were designed Uvic Aero members_

## Performance Data

The following performance data is summarized in the table below. The predicted value is what the multi-rotor was designed to have and the measured value is what the physical machine had when tested.

|Property|Predicted Value|Measured Value|
|---|:---:|:---:|
|Thrust-to-Weight Ratio|3|???
|Endurance|45-50 min|???
|Maximum Forward Velocity|???|???
|Takeoff Weight|10 kg|10 kg|
|Empty Weight| 6 kg| 5.8 kg|
|Payload Capacity| 4 kg| 4.2 kg?|
|Height (Ground to Top platform)|800 mm|800 mm
|Width (Motor to Motor)|1200 mm|1200 mm


_Note: Most of this data is made up_

Thrust to weight ratio and Endurance are calculated with the Takeoff Weight Value.

## Subsystems

This section covers the main subsystems, focusing on their geometric design data.

## Additional Notes

This list goes over some important information that was noticed
* Aircraft becomes unstable roughly 2 m above ground
* Safety Factor of arm pin joint is 2.4, so if same mechanism is used on larger designs make sure the motor thrust is under 2.4 times stronger than the motors used in this design or strengthen the pin.
* Landing gear design required two people to set it up and was not easily compactable, making it a pain to deal with. Copying this design is not advised.
