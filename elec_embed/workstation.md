# The Elec and Embedded Work Station

The Electrical team maintains a work station in the AERO office. This page is devoted to describing its organization, how to keep it clean, how to use the tools, where things are, or really anything else related.

## The Space

The work station is along the back wall in the left corner of the AERO room. It consists of the following:
* Shelving unit: contains most components and parts
* Soldering station: the necessary supplies and tools for soldering
* Wall-mount bins: yellow bins along the wall to hold various tools
* Appliances: oscilloscope, power supplies, and heat gun
